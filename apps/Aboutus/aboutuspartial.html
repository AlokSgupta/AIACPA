                            <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial">AIACPA is an association of individuals who trace their origin to the subcontinent of India. As an organization, AIACPA is a non-partisan/secular association which does not support any political ideology; rather the organization is interested in the democratic process of the country (USA). The Association undertakes several social and cultural activities and initiatives as well. It promotes the interests of Asian Indians and actively works to make the elected officials and policy makers aware of issues and concerns that affect the overarching Asian Indian community. <br />
                                <br />
                               AIACPA is a proud thread in the fabric of Central Pennsylvania, the state, and USA. Along with serving the interests of Asian Indian community, we actively participates in issues/concerns of the local community, Keystone State, and the nation. On an annual basis AIACPA undertakes several activities to promote this important goal.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                AIACPA hopes to spread friendship and understanding between the country of our heritage (India) and our adopted country...... (United States of America). India and America have so much in common. Both countries profess the same core values: functioning democracy, freedom of press, religious freedom, individual liberty, separation of religion and state, primacy of family in the social order. This commonality helps lay the foundation and explains well why these two countries are such natural allies in the world affairs. AIACPA cherishes this and promotes this commonality.

One of our biggest achievements has been to squarely place the Asian Indian community of the Central Pennsylvania area on the political and social map of Pennsylvania and the United States of America. The Founding Members of AIACPA have worked hard to ensure Asian Indians are treated equally both as professionals and individuals. This is a big change from the times when founding members immigrated to America. These members still reflect on the hard time they encountered in getting bank loans, realtors not showing homes in ‘good’ neighborhoods, or enjoyed a sense of ‘belonging’. Today, Asian Indians have cultivated a reputation for professionalism, high levels of education attainment, entrepreneurship, and charity. Examples of how AIACPA has worked to improve the image of Asian Indian Community in Central Pennsylvania include (but are not limited to):</font>
